# ChainForge UI

This is the React frontend for the ChainForge platform.

ChainForge lets users:
- Generate ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 contracts
- Select modules (burnable, pausable, mintable, access control, governance, etc.)
- Deploy tokens via a backend running on Hardhat / testnet
- Download generated contract files and configs
